I never had any real interest at all in mechanical keyboards until recently. I mostly considered them novelties; the kind of thing that was fine as a hobby, but not anything particularly practical.

Over the last year or so, however, I've been going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards, and I've discovered a much richer, more fulfilling world than I ever suspected. There's just something about nerding out over the finest details of the machine you touch and use every day that can be extremely gratifying.

<PullQuote>

My gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

</PullQuote>

It was silly that I never looked any closer at things like keycaps and switches, I now realize. After all, a person who spends all day on their feet will likely care deeply about their shoes; why shouldn't someone whose fingers press keys thousands of times a day be invested in how their fingers feel?

However, unlike many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, I wasn't initially drawn to the hobby by any interest in the feel, sound, look, or performance.

Instead, my gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

## Backstory: my history with keyboards, ergonomics, and RSI

For most of my life, whatever keyboard was attached to or supplied with the computer I was using was just fine with me. Even when I transitioned into full-time design and development, and spent my entire working day at a desk, I rarely gave any thought to the device beneath my fingertips.

Then came 2020, and the pandemic exploded in the US. The home became the workplace. I had been an in-office worker until that point, but haven't been back to work in an office since. Between my work and desperate attempts at escapism, my laptop was pretty much always, well, on top of my lap. (And even when it wasn't, it was probably on a surface that was in no way designed to be a comfortable workstation.)

Over these weeks and months, I developed a repetitive stress injury (RSI), and though I didn't know it then, it would be my first of many. This time, it was my right wrist, pinched by the angle at which it was constantly bent for typing. The pain was ever-present, at times even preventing me from holding things tightly or carrying heavy items, and it became clear it would never subside if I didn't make changes.

Over the first year of working from home full-time, I ended up spending probably around $2,000 on overhauling my at-home workplace to alleviate this pain. New chair, desk, keyboard tray, and—finally—keyboard: my first split keyboard, the [Kinesis Freestyle2 for Mac](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/).

That split keyboard served me well for nearly two years; it got my hands further apart, and allowed my wrists to sit at a more natural angle. But it eventually led to another, different injury: because its layout matched the default layout of a standard Mac keyboard almost identically (apart from the split in the middle, of course), my left thumb was constantly bending at uncomfortable angles to press the command key to initiate shortcuts--in particular, the command + tab shortcut, which I use dozens if not hundreds of times a day.

That's when I started looking at keyboards with thumb keys. It made sense to me that pressing the keys you use most often with your larger, stronger thumbs, rather than with your smaller fingers--and in the natural position of your thumbs--would lead to a better outcome.

So, in asking around (mainly in the [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com) D-D-D-Discord), I eventually wound up with a [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). (Chris Coyier's old one, in fact.)

At first, I hated the Moonlander. No matter how much I configured it, I was horrendously slow, and sucking at something as basic as typing is a maddeningly frustrating experience. More than once, I packed the Moonlander back in its box after a tryout, resolute to never touch it again.

Eventually, though, I decided I would never learn if I didn't go all-in. So put my other keyboards away, and used the Moonlander as my solo keyboard for a few weeks that eventually became several months.

The Moonlander was my daily driver for most of that following year, and for most of that time, I truly loved the keyboard. While the ortholinear (columnar) layout took a lot of getting used to, it paid off and felt amazing once I was finished. I even went so far as to invest in a new set of switches and keycaps for the Moonlander, which made me love it even more.

Over time, however, a new RSI flared up, even with the Moonlander.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

As I write this, I'm still recovering from this latest injury, and diagnosing the cause of it. Some of it, I owe to the Moonlander specifically; some is my own fault for improper setup and usage. Some might be both.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

However, I will say (as I said in my first impressions post): I think the Moonlander is a keyboard that wants to be cool first, and ergonomic second, and my experience with it over the past several months bears that out. The wrist rests are suboptimal, the tenting control you get out of the box is minimal, and the extreme tenting made possible by the Platform add-on comes with its own issues.

I _thought_ if I could get my hands on the similar Ergodox EZ, it might be similar enough to solve my problems. The Ergodox could be used with thick palm rests, and featured extra thumb keys, which sounded nice. Plus, its multiple feet seemed to offer a wider range of tenting and tilting options.

However, the Ergodox didn't turn out to be as different from the Moonlander as I'd hoped. Like the Moonlander, it was a letdown in the range of customizations it offered. Plus, the keyboard was so thick that the tall wrist rests weren't actually much better than the Moonlander's thin mounted plastic ones.

So, much as I loved my Moonlander, it became apparent that _some_ kind of change was necessary.

Again, I should emphasize that despite my valid criticisms of the Moonlander, some of my issues with it were of my own creation. (My choice of tall keycaps may even have contributed.)

But in short: I came to realize the issue came down to where and how my hands were resting when I wasn't actively typing. I don't think the Moonlander lets your palms rest comfortably in just about any position (especially not at higher tenting angles), and over time, the stress of actively holding my hands in place, rather than letting them rest properly, became a painful physical issue for me.

So, again, beset by arm pain (this time in both wrists, as well as my left elbow), I set out to find a solution.

That's when I started thinking maybe the [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) could be the fit I was looking for.

## Why the Glove80?

Ergonomic keyboards cover an incredibly wide spectrum. On one end, they're little more than standard keyboards with a few curves and a palm rest added. (Microsoft's [Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and Logitech's [K350](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k350-wave-ergonomic.920-001996.html) [Ergo K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html) both fit this bill.)

On the other end of the spectrum are keyboards that, well, barely even resemble traditional keyboards. They're often split (i.e., in two pieces, instead of one, allowing the wrists and forearms to sit straight in front of the shoulders instead of pointing awkwardly inwards together), and they frequently have a highly unconventional shape and layout.

<PullQuote>

Even if you've spent some time in this rabbit hole within a rabbit hole, neither Glove80 nor its maker, MoErgo, are likely to be among the main names you've heard of.

</PullQuote>

Some can look unfinished, being little more than raw circuit boards with keys on top. Some are made to be 3D-printable. Others are high-end devices from well-known manufacturers, but which still may look very different from the type of keyboards most people use.

Not all ergonomic keyboards are mechanical, but apart from those by the major brands you'd might find in any average electronics store (like the Microsofts and Logitechs mentioned above), most are; ergonomic keyboards are generally a sub-niche of the mechanical keyboard niche.

Anyway, point is: even if you've spent some time in this rabbit hole within a rabbit hole, though, neither [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) nor its maker, a New Zealand company called [MoErgo](https://www.moergo.com/), are likely to be among the main names you've heard of. Generally, it seems like [Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) and [ZSA](https://www.zsa.io/) have the largest mindshare in the space, though there are others, like [Cloud Nine](https://cloudnineergo.com/), [Dygma](https://dygma.com/) and [UHK](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Nearly as I can tell, MoErgo isn't any more popular than any of the above manufacturers. The Glove80 might quite possibly be the least well-known keyboard of any of the above; just finding reviews for it was challenging. Plus—and I'm sorry in advance, but let's be completely honest here—MoErgo's web design and store are, hands-down, the worst of the bunch.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So: why did I buy the least-known keyboard from the least-popular manufacturer with the least appealing website?

Because I could tell they cared—maybe more than anyone—about actual ergonomics.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

While the design of the website might conjure a small toy store more than a serious international keyboard manufacturer, the Glove80 is no toy, and MoErgo does indeed take it very seriously. (Join the Discord and you'll find the founders regularly responding to questions and issues.)

MoErgo goes to great lengths to explain how and why they landed on the Glove80's design, and it shows. This doesn't feel like a cool keyboard with "ergonomics" slapped on as an afterthought selling point, just because it can tent a little (looking at you, Moonlander).

The Glove80 genuinely feels as though every decision was in service to ergonomics first and foremost, and everything else was secondary.

MoErgo designates a pretty hefty portion of its website and printed materials to telling [the story of the Glove80's design](https://www.moergo.com/pages/glove80-ergonomic-keyboard-design-journey-1). It's undeniably impressive; over 500 experiments and prototypes are laid out in painstaking detail. The journey of assumptions being made, challenged, rethought and re-challenged is a testament to the designers' dedication to arriving at the best possible ergonomic solution.

With all that preamble out of the way, let's get to the main course.

## My impressions of the Glove80

As I'm writing this, I'm a little over a week into using the Glove80 as my full-time daily driver. I initially thought I might do a pros/cons list, but a lot of my observations really aren't either (or, are both at the same time), and so I think I'll take more of a scattershot approach.

### Pricing and shipping

Although the Glove80 is made by a New Zealand company, it ships from China. I initially thought this might mean that shipping would be very expensive, very slow, or possibly both. To my surprise, however, shipping is included with the price of the Glove80, and mine arrived in less than two weeks.

That price tag, I'll note, is certainly far from trivial; the Glove80 will run you $399 USD. That might be a lot for many folks, but that's a pretty fair price for two reasons:

1. Similar models from other manufacturers run similar prices; and (or perhaps _but_)
2. the Glove80 already includes several extras other manufacturers charge extra for.

For example: as mentioned, shipping is included. So are a carrying case (as of October 1st), the attached palm rests, Bluetooth connectivity, backlit keys, and lots of extra parts to customize tenting and tilting to your liking.

<SideNote>

Tenting is the degree to which the keyboard slopes from the lower left and right edges up towards the center; tilting is the degree to which the whole board slopes towards or away from you.

Most all ergonomic keyboards adjust these angles for better comfort than the simple, flat form of standard keyboards. Many allow you to customize one or both yourself.

</SideNote>

In contrast, while the bare-bones version of most similar keyboards run around $300–400, they _also_ often feature a wide range of optional, paid add-ons that quickly drive the price much higher.

It's common for supposedly ergonomic keyboards to only allow a minimal degree of tenting and/or tilting out of the box, but to offer a paid bolt-on to unlock more customization, which might run you over $100 all on its own. Wireless connectivity, if offered, is also usually a premium paid add-on. There may also be costs associated with certain colors, lights, switches, or other features. In many cases, even the palm rests are an extra $30 or more (sometimes as much as $80).

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So while $399 USD might seem steep, know that unlike with most similar keyboards, that's the full and final price; no up-sells or add-ons.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Another credit to MoErgo: unbeknownst to me at the time, I ordered my Glove80 just before the new version of the keyboard began shipping. (It's not significantly different; it mostly just features minor construction improvements, and now comes with a travel case.) MoErgo put the old stock on sale for $20 off, about a week after my order.

Total bummer for me, since I would've either got the newer package, or paid $20 less, if I'd only waited a little longer. But to the company's credit, they took the initiative to automatically issue a $20 store credit to me and to everybody else in the same situation. That speaks well of the company's character.

Plus, that travel case now comes included with all new Glove80s at no extra cost, and that speaks very highly of the folks running the show and what their priorities are, in my opinion.

### Layout customization

The Glove80 uses ZMK software for customization. (Incidentally, the keyboard ships with three default layers, but with the ability to add more.)

I haven't used a lot of keyboard customization software; mainly jut ZSA's Oryx, so that's my only strong point of reference. Using the Glove80's ZMK-based GUI is fairly comparable to Oryx, and relatively simple to use, at least for standard things. Adding a key like hyper or meh is a little more complex (you have to add each individual key separately, which is a little tedious), and it would be nice to have a single button for those instead, but that's a minor quibble.

I also got used to ZSA's autoshift feature, which I don't believe is present in ZMK. But that's easy enough to add with Karabiner, so it's still enabled.

The really noticeable pain point, in terms of customization, appears when you go to flash your layout to the keyboard.

For starters, you have to flash _both_ sides individually. With the Moonlander and Ergodox EZ, just uploading your layout once did the trick. Here, while the left side is the "driver," you still have to upload your layouts to each half individually, which means the process takes about twice as long.

Plus, putting the keyboard into bootloader mode (which is what allows the board to accept a new layout file) is a little tedious in and of itself. With the Moonlander and Ergodox, you just hit a tiny button on the board, and that does the trick. Here, hoever, you have to either designate a special bootloader key in your layout (not too difficult, but remember, you'll need one on each half of the board); or, there are special key combos you can hold when powering on the board to activate bootloader mode, which you can find in the instruction booklet.

This isn't a particularly big pain point for me, personally, since I've already got my preferred layout pretty well dialed-in. But I remember when I started learning the Moonlander, I would often modify my layout multiple times a day, and that sort of on-the-fly experimentation would hit some major friction here.

### Lights

While the Glove80 _does_ have RGB lights under each key, they're very much less full-featured than comparable keyboards. You can't set individual colors per-key, or even per-layer, and there's only a very small number of animations to choose from.

I think this may be a limitation of the open-source ZMK customization software, and I gather that project anticipates some improvements in the future, so some of this may change. But in any case: I wouldn't say the lights are a selling point here.

### Bluetooth

The wireless connectivity has mostly worked very well for me. There have been a couple of instances where I need to reconfigure the board to get things working again, but I think those were probably my fault and not the board's.
