I never had any real interest at all in mechanical keyboards until recently. I mostly considered them novelties; the kind of thing that was fine as a hobby, but not anything particularly practical.

Over the last year or so, however, I've been going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards, and I've discovered a much richer, more fulfilling world than I ever suspected. There's just something about nerding out over the finest details of the machine you touch and use every day that can be extremely gratifying.

<PullQuote>

My gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

</PullQuote>

It was silly that I never looked any closer at things like keycaps and switches, I now realize. After all, a person who spends all day on their feet will likely care deeply about their shoes; why shouldn't someone whose fingers press keys thousands of times a day be invested in how their fingers feel?

However, unlike many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, I wasn't initially drawn to the hobby by any interest in the feel, sound, look, or performance.

Instead, my gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

## Backstory: my history with keyboards, ergonomics, and RSI

For most of my life, whatever keyboard was attached to or supplied with the computer I was using was just fine with me. Even when I transitioned into full-time design and development, and spent my entire working day at a desk, I rarely gave any thought to the device beneath my fingertips.

Then came 2020, and the pandemic exploded in the US. The home became the workplace. I had been an in-office worker until that point, but haven't been back to work in an office since. Between my work and desperate attempts at escapism, my laptop was pretty much always, well, on top of my lap. (And even when it wasn't, it was probably on a surface that was in no way designed to be a comfortable workstation.)

Over these weeks and months, I developed a repetitive stress injury (RSI), and though I didn't know it then, it would be my first of many. This time, it was my right wrist, pinched by the angle at which it was constantly bent for typing. The pain was ever-present, at times even preventing me from holding things tightly or carrying heavy items, and it became clear it would never subside if I didn't make changes.

<figure>

</figure>

Over the first year of working from home full-time, I ended up spending probably around $2,000 on overhauling my at-home workplace to alleviate this pain. New chair, desk, keyboard tray, and—finally—keyboard: my first split keyboard, the [Kinesis Freestyle2 for Mac](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/).

That split keyboard served me well for nearly two years; it got my hands further apart, and allowed my wrists to sit at a more natural angle. But it eventually led to another, different injury: because its layout matched the default layout of a standard Mac keyboard almost identically (apart from the split in the middle, of course), my left thumb was constantly bending at uncomfortable angles to press the command key to initiate shortcuts--in particular, the command + tab shortcut, which I use dozens if not hundreds of times a day.

That's when I started looking at keyboards with thumb keys. It made sense to me that pressing the keys you use most often with your larger, stronger thumbs, rather than with your smaller fingers--and in the natural position of your thumbs--would lead to a better outcome.

So, in asking around (mainly in the [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com) D-D-D-Discord), I eventually wound up with a [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). ([Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net)'s old one, in fact.) You can [read the whole story here](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/moonlander).

At first, I hated the Moonlander. But over time, with dedication and practice, I came to truly love that keyboard. While the ortholinear (columnar grid) layout took a lot of getting used to, it paid off and felt amazing once I was finished. I even went so far as to invest in a new set of switches and keycaps for the Moonlander, which made me love it even more.

Over time, however, a new RSI flared up, even with the Moonlander.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

As I write this, I'm still recovering from, and diagnosing the cause of, this latest injury. Some of it, I owe to the Moonlander specifically; some is my own fault for improper setup and usage. Some might be both.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

The short version is: the Moonlander doesn't really allow your palms to rest. (Or at least, it didn't how I was using it.) So over time, my left arm muscles fatigued from constant usage and no rest; they were always activated, even when I wasn't typing. I had to train myself to move my arm off the keyboard when not in use, since, again, my hand couldn't really rest on it.

I'm not here to tell you the Moonlander is bad, or that it won't work for you. However, I will say (as I said in my [first impressions post](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/moonlander)): I think the Moonlander is a keyboard that wants to be cool first, and ergonomic second, and my experience with it over the past several months bears that out. The wrist rests are suboptimal, the tenting control you get out of the box is minimal, and the extreme tenting made possible by the Platform add-on comes with its own issues.

I _thought_ if I could get my hands on the similar Ergodox EZ, it might solve my problems. The Ergodox could be used with thick palm rests, and featured extra thumb keys, which sounded nice. Plus, its multiple feet seemed to offer a wider range of tenting and tilting options.

However, the Ergodox didn't turn out to be as different from the Moonlander as I'd hoped. Like the Moonlander, it was a letdown in the range of customizations it offered. Plus, the keyboard was so thick that the tall wrist rests weren't actually much better than the Moonlander's thin mounted plastic ones.

Again, I should emphasize that despite my valid criticisms of the Moonlander, some of my issues with it were of my own creation. (My choice of tall keycaps may even have contributed.)

Still, even making all the adjustments I knew how to make, it wasn't working for me. So again, beset by arm pain (this time in both wrists, as well as my left elbow), I set out to find a solution.

That's when I started thinking maybe the [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) could be the fit I was looking for.

## Why the Glove80?

Ergonomic keyboards cover an incredibly wide spectrum. On one end, they're little more than standard keyboards with a few curves and a palm rest added. (Microsoft's [Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and Logitech's [K350](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k350-wave-ergonomic.920-001996.html) [Ergo K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html) both fit this bill.)

On the other end of the spectrum are keyboards that, well, barely even resemble traditional keyboards. They're often split (i.e., in two pieces, instead of one, allowing the wrists and forearms to sit straight in front of the shoulders instead of pointing awkwardly inwards together), and they frequently have a highly unconventional shape and layout.

<PullQuote>

Even if you've spent some time in this rabbit hole within a rabbit hole, neither Glove80 nor its maker, MoErgo, are likely to be among the main names you've heard of.

</PullQuote>

Some can look unfinished, being little more than raw circuit boards with keys on top. Some are made to be 3D-printable. Others are high-end devices from well-known manufacturers, but which still may look very different from the type of keyboards most people use.

<figure>

</figure>

Not all ergonomic keyboards are mechanical, but apart from those by the major brands you'd might find in any average electronics store (like the Microsofts and Logitechs mentioned above), most are; ergonomic keyboards are generally a sub-niche of the mechanical keyboard niche.

Anyway, point is: even if you've spent some time in this rabbit hole within a rabbit hole, though, neither [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) nor its maker, a New Zealand company called [MoErgo](https://www.moergo.com/), are likely to be among the main names you've heard of. Generally, it seems like [Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) and [ZSA](https://www.zsa.io/) have the largest mindshare in the space, though there are others, like [Cloud Nine](https://cloudnineergo.com/), [Dygma](https://dygma.com/) and [UHK](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Nearly as I can tell, MoErgo isn't any more popular than any of the above manufacturers. The Glove80 might quite possibly be the least well-known keyboard of any of the above; just finding reviews for it was challenging. Plus—and I'm sorry in advance, but let's be completely honest here—MoErgo's web design and store are, hands-down, the worst of the bunch.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So: why did I buy the least-known keyboard from the least-popular manufacturer with the least appealing website?

Because I could tell they cared—maybe more than anyone—about actual ergonomics.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

While the design of the website might conjure a small toy store more than a serious international keyboard manufacturer, the Glove80 is no toy, and MoErgo does indeed take it very seriously. (Join the Discord and you'll find the founders regularly responding to questions and issues.)

MoErgo goes to great lengths to explain how and why they landed on the Glove80's design, and it shows. This doesn't feel like a cool keyboard with "ergonomics" slapped on as an afterthought selling point, just because it can tent a little (looking at you, Moonlander).

The Glove80 genuinely feels as though every decision was in service to ergonomics first and foremost, and everything else was secondary.

MoErgo designates a pretty hefty portion of its website and printed materials to telling [the story of the Glove80's design](https://www.moergo.com/pages/glove80-ergonomic-keyboard-design-journey-1). It's undeniably impressive; over 500 experiments and prototypes are laid out in painstaking detail. The journey of assumptions being made, challenged, rethought and re-challenged is a testament to the designers' dedication to arriving at the best possible ergonomic solution.

With all that preamble out of the way, let's get to the main course.

## My impressions of the Glove80

As I'm writing this, I'm a little over a week into using the Glove80 as my full-time daily driver. I initially thought I might do a pros/cons list, but a lot of my observations really aren't either (or, are both at the same time), and so I think I'll take more of a scattershot approach.

<figure>

<img src="/images/post_images/glove80/mine.webp" alt="" />

<figcaption>My Glove80, with some of the keys rearranged from their original positions. Most do what they say, but because no extra keys are included, a few don't.</figcaption>

</figure>

### Pricing and shipping

Although the Glove80 is made by a New Zealand company, it ships from China. I initially thought this might mean that shipping would be very expensive, very slow, or possibly both. To my surprise, however, shipping is included with the price of the Glove80, and mine arrived in less than two weeks.

That price tag, I'll note, is certainly far from trivial; the Glove80 will run you $399 USD. That might be a lot for many folks, but that's a pretty fair price for two reasons:

1. Similar models from other manufacturers run similar prices; and (or perhaps _but_)
2. the Glove80 already includes several extras other manufacturers charge extra for.

For example: as mentioned, shipping is included. So are a carrying case (as of October 1st), the attached palm rests, Bluetooth connectivity, backlit keys, and lots of extra parts to customize tenting and tilting to your liking.

<SideNote>

Tenting is the degree to which the keyboard slopes from the lower left and right edges up towards the center; tilting is the degree to which the whole board slopes towards or away from you.

Most all ergonomic keyboards adjust these angles for better comfort than the simple, flat form of standard keyboards. Many allow you to customize one or both yourself.

</SideNote>

In contrast, while the bare-bones version of most similar keyboards run around $300–400, they _also_ often feature a wide range of optional, paid add-ons that quickly drive the price much higher.

It's common for supposedly ergonomic keyboards to only allow a minimal degree of tenting and/or tilting out of the box, but to offer a paid bolt-on to unlock more customization, which might run you over $100 all on its own. Wireless connectivity, if offered, is also usually a premium paid add-on. There may also be costs associated with certain colors, lights, switches, or other features. In many cases, even the palm rests are an extra $30 or more (sometimes as much as $80).

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So while $399 USD might seem steep, know that unlike with most similar keyboards, that's the full and final price; no up-sells or add-ons.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Another credit to MoErgo: unbeknownst to me at the time, I ordered my Glove80 just before the new version of the keyboard began shipping. (It's not significantly different; it mostly just features minor construction improvements, and now comes with a travel case.) MoErgo put the old stock on sale for $20 off, about a week after my order.

Total bummer for me, since I would've either got the newer package, or paid $20 less, if I'd only waited a little longer. But to the company's credit, they took the initiative to automatically issue a $20 store credit to me and to everybody else in the same situation. That speaks well of the company's character.

Plus, that travel case now comes included with all new Glove80s at no extra cost, and that speaks very highly of the folks running the show and what their priorities are, in my opinion.

### Layout customization

Like many keyboard manufacturers, MoErgo has their own layout editor app, available at [my.glove80.com](https://my.glove80.com/). This is where you go to make changes to your layout. Under the hood, this app uses open-source [ZMK software](https://zmk.dev/) for customization. The keyboard ships with three default layers: layer 0, layer 1, and the "magic" layer, which is triggered by the conspicuous MoErgo logo key, and which holds most of the hardware controls, like lights and Bluetooth. You have the ability to add more layers, if desired.

I haven't used a lot of keyboard customization software; mainly jut ZSA's Oryx, so that's my only real point of reference. Using the Glove80's ZMK-based GUI is fairly comparable to Oryx, and relatively simple to use, at least for standard things. Adding a complex modifier like hyper (`cmd` + `opt` + `shift` + `ctrl`) is a little more involved; you have to add each individual modifier separately, making this example a four-step process. It would be nice to have a single button for those instead, but that's a minor quibble.

I notice MoErgo's layout editor doesn't let you do much besides change the keys themselves, unlike Oryx, which boasts a massive range of other options related to your keyboard. I didn't use most of them, but one I did particularly like was autoshift, which lets you long-press a key instead of shift-pressing, which I find handy. It's nice to just press the "a" key for slightly longer to get an uppercase "A," (or to change `[` to `{`), rather than getting another finger involved, especially when you're still learning your layout.

<figure>

<figcaption>The Glove80 layout editor at <a href="https://my.glove80.com">my.glove80.com</a></figcaption>

</figure>

Autoshift alone is easy enough to add with [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), so it's still enabled. I prefer it that way, actually; it lets me use autoshift even when using the built-in laptop keyboard.

Anyway, though it's less full-featured than Oryx, the layout editor works great for customizing keys. But if you want to go any deeper than that, you'll likely have to write your own code. (There's a box for you to put your own custom code into in the editor, with a strong "make sure you know what you're doing" caveat.) Fine, and probably even better for some power users, but I'll likely never touch it if it's not in the GUI, and I'm guessing a lot of users won't either.

Anyway, when you're done making changes in your editor, it generates a layout file that you then upload to your keyboard. (This is often called "flashing.")

<CalloutPlusQuote>

One noticeable pain point: when modifying your layout, you're required to flash each side of the keyboard separately.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

With the Moonlander and Ergodox EZ, just uploading your layout once did the trick. Here, once you have your customization file downloaded, you'll need to put each half of the keyboard in bootloader mode, and upload the config file to each one.

<SideNote>

I've been told that as long as all you're doing is changing the key mappings, you should be able to get away with only uploading the layout to the left half. However, I was warned against this by the manufacturer.

</SideNote>

Plus, putting the keyboard into bootloader mode (which is what allows the board to accept a new layout file) is a little tedious in and of itself. With the Moonlander and Ergodox, you just hit a tiny button on the board, and that does the trick. Here, however, you have to either designate a special bootloader key in your layout (not too difficult, but remember, you'll need one on each half of the board); or, there are special key combos you can hold when powering on the board to activate bootloader mode (a little like holding shift while powering on your computer to boot in safe mode). You can find these combos in the instruction booklet.

This isn't a particularly big pain point for me, personally, since I've already got my preferred layout pretty well dialed-in. But I remember when I started learning the Moonlander, I would often modify my layout multiple times a day, and that sort of on-the-fly experimentation would hit some major friction here.

In fairness, having a bootloader key available, instead of being forced to use a teensy pinhole button, might be considered a pro. That's fair enough, but it brings up another quibble, which is: it's fairly easy to accidentally hit a key or key combo that interferes with the normal operation of the keyboard.

If you have a bootloader key, you might hit it accidentally. There's a key that resets Bluetooth; I hit it on accident--even though it was buried in the special Magic layer (I was trying to toggle the LEDs, incidentally), and was forced to pair my keyboard all over again. No big deal, but it's a potential hazard.

This section has gotten pretty long with various quibbles and minor issues. None of them are substantial on their own, but they stack up to make use of this keyboard a potentially daunting affair.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

The level of technical know-how required to use and modify the Glove80 makes it pretty hard to recommend to beginners or casual users.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Even customizing the layout might be tricky for non-tech-savvy folks--especially knowing how easy it is to accidentally mess something up and be forced to go digging through the troubleshooting FAQ.

That said, I gather ZMK is actively developed software with planned future improvements, so maybe that, and/or MoErgo's own customization tool, will become a bit more friendly to casual users as time goes on.

### Lights

While the Glove80 _does_ have RGB lights under each key, the lighting seems less full-featured than comparable keyboards. You can't set individual colors per-key, or even per-layer.

I think this may be a limitation of ZMK (the customization software MoErgo's editor is built on), so maybe some of this may change. (Or, if you're savvy enough, maybe you could program your way around it?)

But in any case: I wouldn't say the lights are a selling point here. They're neat, and maybe nice to have. They can look pretty cool in the dark, but they accelerate battery usage when in wireless mode, and there are only a few lighting options to choose from anyway.

There's a nice rainbow animation that slides across all the keys (my personal favorite). If you're not using that animation, every key has to be the same color, but you can choose whether they stay lit, gradually pulse off and on, or rotate through hues in sync all together. All of this is set using the keys on the Magic layer, rather than in the layout editor. (And, of course, you can just leave the lights off.)

<figure>

![The right half of the Glove80 in the dark, keys illuminated in rainbow colors](/images/post_images/glove80/rainbow.webp)

<figcaption>A still of the rainbow animation</figcaption>

</figure>

I personally wouldn't have missed the lights--or at least, wouldn't have minded if they were just there to provide a little light in the dark and didn't have all the customization options. Still, they're a nice little add-on, I suppose.

One other note on the topic of lights: MoErgo cleverly decided to use the RGB lights as a status indicator. When you hit the Magic key (that's the one with the MoErgo logo), the left half illuminates to show the battery level of each half of the keyboard, which layer is currently active, key lock status, and Bluetooth status.

![The left half of the Glove80 with limited keys lit up to convey the current state of the keyboard, as described in the paragraph above. The second and third rows of keys serve as battery indicators, with more keys lit left to right to indicate a higher charge per half.](/images/post_images/glove80/status.webp)

### Wireless and battery

The wireless connectivity has mostly worked very well for me. Only the left half connects to your host machine via Bluetooth; the right half then just connects with the left.

There have been a couple of instances where the halves lost connection with each other and I needed to do some troubleshooting to get them reconnected, but I'm fairly sure those were both my fault, and caused by improper resets. In any case, re-flashing the right half was all it took to set things right again, so no big deal.

With the comparable keyboards I've used, just one half needed to be powered by the host, and the other half is connected via a cable. With the Glove80, however, both halves are powered by USB-C.

This is both a pro and a con. It's nice that there's no wire running between the halves, and each can be independently positioned wherever you like, however close or far from the other half. (I often store my phone and other objects between the halves of my split, so that's nice.)

However, it's a con because it means you'll need to keep an eye on the power of both halves. That said, though, the battery life seems to be very good.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

I've used my Glove80 in wireless mode almost the entire time I've had it, and it seems like each half would easily last at least a few days on a full charge, maybe more.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

(_Note that this is without the RGB lights on, however; if you're using those, I'd recommend plugging both halves in_.)

Each half has an independent power button, which is just a small springy nub of a switch that feels a little on the cheap side. However, since the keyboard automatically sleeps when not in use, in practice, I've rarely had a reason to turn either side off.

### Ok fine but how does it actually feel?

Maybe I kinda buried the lede here. The Glove80 generally feels _great_. I find myself placing my hands on it just to feel it whenever I walk through the room.

It should be noted that MoErgo sees the Glove80 as a kind of spiritual successor to the [Kinesis Advantage](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/); a sort of "platform" for your hands with a scooped-out key well for each set of fingers. For many years, the Advantage was one of the only really innovative ergonomic keyboards on the market, and it seems the MoErgo makers were fans. But while it was perhaps revolutionary for its time (its layout appears to have inspired the current generation of ortholinear keyboards), it left room for improvement and iteration.

I've never used a "scooped" keyboard before, but I find the feeling surprisingly natural. However, that's with the strong caveat that I've already put my time in with ortholinear boards, and know how to touch type with them well coming in. No matter what your first ortholinear keyboard is, I'd recommend expecting a ramp up time of at least a week or two with daily practice, maybe up to a couple of months.

One of the main ergonomic goals of the Glove80 seems to be keeping your wrists in as much of a natural position as possible. That is: not bent outwards, inwards, up, or down; just flat at the same angle as your forearm.

To achieve this with a scooped layout, MoErgo opted for low-profile switches and keys (Kailh Choc v1 low profile switches, specifically, and MCC-profile keycaps—more on those in another section).

What this means is: the keys on the Glove80 are significantly taller than those on an Apple laptop or the Apple keyboard, but still also significantly shorter than any other mechanical keyboard. I opted for brown switches on my board, and they feel quite a bit like Cherry Browns, despite a lower travel distance. (If that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry. It just means the keys have a modest bump and are moderately springy, and while they make some a little bit of sound, they aren't loud or clicky.)

Many reviewers have commented how easy it is to slide your fingers up and down the columns of keys, and I've also had this experience. Gliding up or down from the home row is so easy I often find myself overshooting.

Which reminds me: many reviewers _also_ comment that the Glove80 works well for folks with smaller than average hands. My hands are about average size, maybe a bit on the small side for a male, and I can confirm that I can reach any key without any issue. Again: sometimes I even _overreach_, just because the keys are nestled so nicely together.

You might notice that each column of the keyboard is scooped at a little different depth, to accommodate each individual finger length. That might look funky, but honestly, it hasn't been an issue in my experience. If anything, it's kind of helpful; one of my more petty gripes with the Glove80 is that it doesn't include homing keys. (You can buy them, but not printed; they're just blank, which is a bummer.) On other boards, I rely on homing keys to make sure my fingers are in the proper position without looking, but here, thanks to those individually scooped finger trenches, if you're off the mark, you'll probably realize it right away.

### Switches and keycaps

One of the biggest bummers about the Glove80 is that the switches are not hot-swappable; they're soldered in place.

The reasoning makes sense; it's a manufacturing concern. It's apparently tough to get swappable switches as close together as the Glove80's keys are, and to ensure consistent quality. So, while you won't be able to change your mind about your switches after you've purchased your keyboard, at least you _can_ still repair it, if you've got the soldering expertise or can find somebody who does.

The Glove80 ships with your choice of four switches (really, three): Red, Red Pro, White, and Brown. Like I mentioned, I got the brown, and while I'm ok with them, I wish there was an option with a little more oomph. (I used Glorious Pandas on my Moonlander and absolutely loved them.)

The Red and Red Pro are both linear switches, which means they don't have any bump or clickiness to them; they just go straight down silently when you press them. (I personally can't stand linear switches; I like to _feel_ my keypresses register. But if you're gaming, or doing something else where every millisecond counts, reds are apparently the way to go.) The Pro version requires less force to press, so it might be nice if you have weak fingers or RSI that gets in the way of applying force.

The Brown and White appear to be identical, except that the White makes a clicking sound when pressed, and the Brown does not. Both are tactile switches, which means you feel a bump when you press them.

Not an impressive array of choices, unfortunately, but at least every major category of switch is represented.

As for the keycaps: Choc v1 keycaps are extremely difficult to find, in my experience. This would seem to be because Choc v1 uses its own stem (generally just referred to as Choc), which looks a bit like an electrical plug, instead of the de facto industry standard Cherry stem.

<figure>

<img src="/images/post_images/glove80/choc-vs-cherry.jpg" alt="" />

<figcaption>Kailh Choc v1 switch with proprietary Choc stem, left; Choc v2 switch featuring a standard Cherry-compatible stem, right.</figcaption>

</figure>

MoErgo made this decision deliberately, however; many feel that the v2 switches, despite wider compatibility, only really manage to be the worst of both worlds. Many standard Cherry-compatible keycaps _aren't_ actually compatible with the low profile switch, and that's doubly true when the keys are so close together and angled towards each other, as on the Glove80. Choc v2 switches are also marginally taller than Choc v1, and apparently significantly less popular for the reasons above.

Anyway: still, even though v1 is by all accounts better and more popular than v2, it can still be challenging to find Choc keycaps. (That said, there are at least three profiles available; the Glove80 ships with MCC profile, which is slightly sloped to create a vertical halfpipe shape, but there's also MBK and MBK Convex.)
