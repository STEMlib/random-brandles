I never had any real interest at all in mechanical keyboards until recently. I mostly considered them novelties; the kind of thing that was fine as a hobby, but not anything particularly practical.

Over the last year or so, however, I've been going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards, and I've discovered a much richer, more fulfilling world than I ever suspected. There's just something about nerding out over the finest details of the machine you touch and use every day that can be extremely gratifying.

<PullQuote>

My gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

</PullQuote>

It was silly that I never looked any closer at things like keycaps and switches, I now realize. After all, a person who spends all day on their feet will likely care deeply about their shoes; why shouldn't someone whose fingers press keys thousands of times a day be invested in how their fingers feel?

However, unlike most mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, I wasn't initially drawn to the hobby by any interest in the feel, sound, look, or performance.

Instead, my gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

## Backstory: my history with keyboards, ergonomics, and RSI

For most of my life, whatever keyboard was attached to or supplied with the computer I was using was just fine with me. I rarely gave any thought to the device resting beneath my fingertips.

Then came 2020, and the pandemic exploded in the US. The home became the workplace. Between the constant demands of remote work and desperate attempts at escapism, my laptop was pretty much always, well, on top of my lap. (And even when it wasn't, it was probably on a surface that was in no way designed to be a comfortable workstation.)

Over these weeks and months, I developed a repetitive stress injury (RSI), and though I didn't know it then, it would be my first of many. My right wrist, constantly pinched, was in ever-present and worsening pain, which was at times so bad I couldn't even hold things tightly or carry heavy items.

It became clear I couldn't keep going without making changes.

</figure>

<CalloutPlusQuote>

Over the first year of working from home, I ended up spending around $2,000 overhauling my home workstation to alleviate the pain and prevent new injuries.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

(_What a great system that makes people who have the hardest time working pay way more to do it_.)

I got a new chair, new desk, added a keyboard tray, and—finally—purchased my first split keyboard: the [Kinesis Freestyle2 for Mac](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/).

That split keyboard served me well for nearly two years; it got my hands further apart, and allowed my wrists to sit at a more natural angle. But it eventually led to another, different injury: my left thumb was constantly bending at uncomfortable angles to press the command key to initiate shortcuts.

That's when I started looking at keyboards with thumb keys, and ended up with a [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/). [I wrote about that story here](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/moonlander).

At first, I hated the Moonlander. The ortholinear (columnar grid) layout took a lot of getting used to, but it paid off and felt amazing once I got it down. To learn was to love. I even went so far as to invest in a new set of switches and keycaps for the Moonlander, which made me love it even more.

Over time, however, a new RSI flared up, even with the Moonlander.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

As I write this, I'm still recovering from this latest injury. Some of it, I owe to the Moonlander specifically; some is my own fault for improper setup and usage. Some might be both.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

I was adjusting the Moonlander a dozen times a day trying to figure out the problem. Turns out: it doesn't really allow your hands to just _rest_ when they're not typing. (Or at least, it didn't how I was using it.) So over time, my left arm muscles fatigued from constant activation. I had to train myself to move my arm off the keyboard when not in use, since, again, there wasn't any really comfortable way to just rest my hand (especially when using the Platform for higher tenting angles).

I'm not here to tell you the Moonlander is bad, or that it won't work for you. However, I will [say again](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/moonlander): I think the Moonlander is a keyboard that wants to be cool first, and ergonomic second.

I initially thought the similar [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) might solve my problems, with its thicker palm rests. However, the keyboard was so thick that the tall wrist rests weren't actually much better than the Moonlander's thin mounted plastic ones. And sadly, like the Moonlander, the Ergodox was a letdown in the range of customizations it offered.

Again, I should emphasize that despite valid criticisms of the Moonlander, some of my issues with it were of my own creation. (My choice of tall keycaps may even have contributed.)

<CalloutPlusQuote>

Ergonomics are highly personal, and even a great keyboard may or may not solve RSI issues, or prevent future injuries.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

All the keyboards I rejected above worked great for me at one point, after all.

Still, even making all the adjustments I knew how to make--despite how much I loved the feel of it--the Moonlander just wasn't working for me anymore. So again, beset by arm pain (this time in both wrists, as well as my left elbow), I set out to find a solution.

That's when I started thinking maybe the [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) could be the fit I was looking for.

## Why the Glove80?

<Summary>

- Although it's not the most popular or flashy, the Glove80 seems to put ergonomics first like few other manufacturers.


</Summary>

Ergonomic keyboards cover an incredibly wide spectrum. On one end, they're little more than standard keyboards with a few curves, a gap in the middle, and/or a palm rest added. (Microsoft's [Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and Logitech's [K350](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k350-wave-ergonomic.920-001996.html) and [Ergo K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html) fit this bill.)

On the other end of the spectrum are devices that barely even resemble traditional keyboards. They're often split (i.e., in two pieces, instead of one, allowing the wrists and forearms to sit straight in front of the shoulders instead of pointing awkwardly inwards together), and they frequently have a highly unconventional shape and layout.

<PullQuote>

Even within the nested rabbit hole of ergonomic mechanical keyboards, neither Glove80 nor its maker, MoErgo, are likely to be among the main names you've heard of.

</PullQuote>

Some can look unfinished, being little more than raw circuit boards with keys on top. Some are made to be 3D-printable. Others are high-end devices from well-known manufacturers.

Not all ergonomic keyboards are mechanical (or split, for that matter; that's a three-circle Venn diagram), but apart from the major brands you might find in any average electronics store, most are; ergonomic keyboards are very often a sub-niche of the mechanical keyboard niche.

<figure>

<figcaption>A wide range of ergonomic, split, and/or mechanical keyboards. Image from <a href="https://www.rtings.com/keyboard/reviews/best/ergonomic">rtings.com</a>.</figcaption>

</figure>

Anyway, point is: even within the nested rabbit hole of ergonomic mechanical keyboards, neither [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) nor its maker, a New Zealand company called [MoErgo](https://www.moergo.com/), are likely to be among the main names you've heard of. Generally, it seems like [Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) and [ZSA](https://www.zsa.io/) have the largest mindshare in the space (though there are others, like [Cloud Nine](https://cloudnineergo.com/), [Dygma](https://dygma.com/) and [UHK](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/)).

Nearly as I can tell, the MoErgo Glove80 is a dark horse; just finding reviews for it was challenging. I can't help but wonder how much of that is due to MoErgo's website design; their store has a highly dated and not particularly professional look and feel. It's definitely not a website that inspires confidence in the product, at least not at a glance.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So: why did I buy a relatively unknown keyboard from a comparatively small manufacturer with a highly questionable website?

Because I could tell they cared—maybe more than anyone—about actual ergonomics.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

While MoErgo's website does more to conjure a small toy store than a serious international keyboard manufacturer, the Glove80 is no toy, and MoErgo does indeed take it very seriously. (Join the Discord and you'll find the founders fastidiously responding to questions and issues.)

MoErgo goes to great lengths to explain how and why they landed on the Glove80's design, and it shows. This doesn't feel like a cool keyboard with "ergonomics" slapped on as an afterthought selling point, just because it can tent a little. [_Side-eyes ZSA_]

<CalloutPlusQuote>

The Glove80 genuinely feels as though every decision was in service to ergonomics first and foremost, and everything else was secondary.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

MoErgo designates a pretty hefty portion of its website and printed materials to telling [the story of the Glove80's design](https://www.moergo.com/pages/glove80-ergonomic-keyboard-design-journey-1). It's undeniably impressive; over 500 experiments and prototypes are laid out in painstaking detail. The journey of assumptions being made, challenged, rethought and re-challenged is a testament to the designers' dedication to arriving at the best possible ergonomic solution.

---

With all that preamble out of the way, let's get to the main course.

As I'm writing this, I'm a couple of weeks into using the Glove80 as my full-time daily driver. I initially thought I might do a pros/cons list, but a lot of my observations really aren't either (or, are both at the same time), and so I think I'll take more of a scattershot approach.

<figure>

<img src="/images/post_images/glove80/mine.webp" alt="" />

</figure>

## Pricing and shipping

<Summary>

- A thing
- Another thing, again
- This is a third thing, which might go on a little longer than the other two things.

</Summary>

Although the Glove80 is made by a New Zealand company, it ships from China. I initially thought this might mean that shipping would be very expensive, very slow, or possibly both. To my surprise, however, shipping is included with the price of the Glove80, and mine arrived in less than two weeks.

That price, I'll note, is certainly far from trivial; the Glove80 will run you $399 USD. That's quite steep for many folks, but all things considered, it's a fair price; similar models from other manufacturers run in that same area, but the Glove80 already includes several extras other manufacturers might charge extra for.

For example: as mentioned, shipping is included. So are the palm rests, Bluetooth connectivity, backlit keys, and lots of extra parts to customize tenting and tilting to your liking. It even includes a padded travel case now (although it didn't when I ordered mine).

<SideNote>

Tenting is the degree to which the keyboard slopes from the lower left and right edges up towards the center; tilting is the degree to which the whole board slopes towards or away from you.

Most all ergonomic keyboards adjust these angles for better comfort than the simple, flat form of standard keyboards. Many allow you to customize one or both yourself.

</SideNote>

In contrast, it's common for supposedly ergonomic keyboards to only allow a minimal degree of tenting and/or tilting out of the box, but to offer a paid bolt-on to unlock more customization, which might run you over $100 all on its own. Wireless connectivity, if offered, is also usually a premium paid add-on. There may also be costs associated with certain colors, lights, switches, or other features. In many cases, even the palm rests are an extra $30 or more (sometimes as much as $80).

<CalloutPlusQuote>

So while $399 USD might seem steep, know that unlike with most similar keyboards, that's the full and final price; no up-sells or add-ons.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Another credit to MoErgo: unbeknownst to me at the time, I ordered my Glove80 just before the new version of the keyboard began shipping. (It's not significantly different; it mostly just features minor construction improvements, and now comes with a travel case.) MoErgo put the old stock on sale for $20 off, about a week after my order.

Total bummer for me, since I would've either got the newer package, or paid $20 less, if I'd only waited a little longer. But to the company's credit, they took the initiative to automatically issue a $20 store credit to me and to everybody else in the same situation. That speaks well of the company's character.

Plus, that travel case now comes included with all new Glove80s at no extra cost, and that speaks very highly of the folks running the show and what their priorities are. You get the sense that MoErgo is willing to sacrifice profits to make people happy, and that's one of the best things you can say about a company, if you ask me.

## Layout customization

Like many keyboard manufacturers, MoErgo has their own layout editor app, available at [my.glove80.com](https://my.glove80.com/). This is where you go to make changes to your layout; when you're done, you download a config file, and upload it to your keyboard.

Under the hood, this app uses open-source [ZMK software](https://zmk.dev/) for customization. The keyboard ships with three default layers: layer 0, layer 1, and the "magic" layer, which is triggered by the conspicuous MoErgo logo key, and which holds most of the hardware controls, like lights and Bluetooth. You have the ability to add more layers, if desired.

I haven't used a lot of keyboard customization software; mainly jut ZSA's Oryx, so that's my only real point of reference. MoErgo's app is similar and simple, at least for fairly standard things. Adding a complex modifier like hyper (`cmd` + `opt` + `shift` + `ctrl`) is a little more involved; you have to add each individual modifier separately, making this example a four-step process. It would be nice to have a single button for those instead, but that's a minor quibble.

I notice the editor is fairly straightforward; while you can customize key presses in a pretty wide variety of ways, you can't do much _besides_ customizing keys.

That is, with Oryx, there's a wide range of keyboard options, too. I didn't use most of them, but one I did particularly like was autoshift, which lets you long-press a key instead of shift-pressing, which I find handy. It's nice to just press the "a" key for slightly longer to get an uppercase "A," (or, `[` to get `{`), rather than getting another finger involved, especially when you're still learning your layout or when it's a stretch.

<figure>

<figcaption>The Glove80 layout editor at <a href="https://my.glove80.com">my.glove80.com</a></figcaption>

</figure>

Autoshift alone is easy enough to add with [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), so it's still enabled. I prefer it that way, actually; it lets me use autoshift even when using the built-in laptop keyboard.

Anyway, though it's less full-featured than Oryx, the layout editor works great for customizing keys. But if you want to go any deeper than that, you'll likely have to write your own code. (There's a box for you to put your own custom code into in the editor, with a strong "make sure you know what you're doing" caveat.) Fine, and probably even better for some power users, but I'll likely never touch it if it's not in the GUI, and I'm guessing a lot of users won't either.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

One noticeable pain point: when modifying your layout, you're required to flash each side of the keyboard separately.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

With the Moonlander and Ergodox EZ, just uploading your layout once did the trick. Here, once you have your customization file downloaded, you'll need to put each half of the keyboard in bootloader mode, and upload the config file to each one.

<SideNote>

I've been told that as long as all you're doing is changing the key mappings, you should be able to get away with only uploading the layout to the left half. However, I was warned against this by the manufacturer.

</SideNote>

Plus, putting the keyboard into bootloader mode (which is what allows the board to accept a new layout file) is a little tedious in and of itself. With the Moonlander and Ergodox, you just hit a tiny button on the board, and that does the trick. Here, however, you have to either designate a special bootloader key in your layout (not too difficult, but remember, you'll need one on each half of the board); or, there are special key combos you can hold when powering on the board to activate bootloader mode (a little like holding shift while powering on your computer to boot in safe mode). You can find these combos in the instruction booklet.

This isn't a particularly big pain point for me, personally, since I've already got my preferred layout pretty well dialed-in. But I remember when I started learning the Moonlander, I would often modify my layout multiple times a day, and that sort of on-the-fly experimentation would hit some major friction here.

In fairness, having a bootloader key available, instead of being forced to use a teensy pinhole button, might be considered a pro. That's fair enough, but it brings up another quibble, which is: it's fairly easy to accidentally hit a key or key combo that interferes with the normal operation of the keyboard.

If you have a bootloader key, you might hit it accidentally. There's a key that resets Bluetooth which I hit on accident once, even though it was buried in the special Magic layer (I was trying to toggle the LEDs, incidentally), and was forced to pair my keyboard all over again. No big deal, but it's a potential hazard.

This section has gotten pretty long with various quibbles and minor issues. None of them are substantial on their own, but they stack up to make use of this keyboard a potentially daunting affair.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

The level of technical know-how required to use and modify the Glove80 makes it pretty hard to recommend to beginners or casual users.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Even customizing the layout might be tricky for non-tech-savvy folks--especially knowing how easy it is to accidentally mess something up and be forced to go digging through the troubleshooting FAQ.

That said, I gather ZMK is actively developed software with planned future improvements, so maybe that, and/or MoErgo's own customization tool, will become a bit more friendly to casual users as time goes on.

## Lights

While the Glove80 _does_ have RGB lights under each key, the lighting seems a little less full-featured than comparable keyboards. Unless you're using the built-in rainbow animation, every key has to be the same color; you can't customize per-key or per-layout.

This _may_ be a limitation of ZMK (I'm not sure), so maybe some of this may change. Or, if you're savvy enough, maybe you could program your way around it. There are forks of ZMK that do extra things, but that of course is "you better know what you're doing" territory.

In any case: I wouldn't say the lights are a major selling point here. They're neat. They can look pretty cool in the dark. But they accelerate battery usage when in wireless mode, and there are only a few lighting options to choose from anyway.

There's a nice rainbow animation that slides across all the keys (my personal favorite). If you're not using that animation, every key has to be the same color, but you can choose whether they stay lit, gradually pulse off and on, or rotate through hues in sync all together. All of this is set using the keys on the Magic layer, rather than in the layout editor. (And, of course, you can just leave the lights off.)

<figure>

![The right half of the Glove80 in the dark, keys illuminated in rainbow colors](/images/post_images/glove80/rainbow.webp)

<figcaption>A still of the rainbow animation</figcaption>

</figure>

I personally wouldn't have missed the lights--or at least, wouldn't have minded if they were just there to provide a little light in the dark and didn't have all the customization options. Still, they're a nice little add-on, I suppose.

One other note on the topic of lights, though: MoErgo cleverly decided to use the RGB lights as a status indicator. When you hit the Magic key (that's the one with the MoErgo logo), the left half illuminates to show the battery level of each half of the keyboard, which layer is currently active, key lock status, and Bluetooth status.

![The left half of the Glove80 with limited keys lit up to convey the current state of the keyboard, as described in the paragraph above. The second and third rows of keys serve as battery indicators, with more keys lit left to right to indicate a higher charge per half.](/images/post_images/glove80/status.webp)

It's a clever workaround that lets you access that information without the need for any additional software. (Come to think of it: I didn't need to install _anything_ to start using the Glove80, which is nice.)

## Wireless and battery

The wireless connectivity has mostly worked very well for me. Only the left half connects to your host machine via Bluetooth; the right half then just connects with the left.

There have been a couple of instances where the halves lost connection with each other and I needed to do some troubleshooting to get them reconnected, but I'm fairly sure those were both my fault, and caused by improper resets. In any case, re-flashing the right half was all it took to set things right again, so no big deal.

With the comparable keyboards I've used, just one half needed to be powered by the host, and the other half is connected via a cable. With the Glove80, however, both halves are powered by USB-C.

This is both a pro and a con. It's nice that there's no wire running between the halves, and that each can be independently positioned wherever you like, however close or far from the other half. (I often store my phone and other objects between the halves of my split, so that's convenient.)

However, it's a con because it means you'll need to keep an eye on the power of both halves. That said, though, the battery life seems to be very good.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

I've used my Glove80 in wireless mode almost the entire time I've had it, and it seems like each half would easily last at least a few days on a full charge, maybe more.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

(_Note that this is without the RGB lights on, however; if you're using those, I'd recommend plugging both halves in_.)

Each half has an independent power button, which is just a small springy nub of a switch that feels a little on the cheap side. However, since the keyboard automatically sleeps when not in use, in practice, I've rarely had a reason to turn either side off.

## Ok but how does it actually feel?

Maybe I kinda buried the lede here. All right, let's get into it:

<CalloutPlusQuote>

The Glove80 generally feels _great_. I find myself placing my hands on it just to feel it whenever I walk through the room.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

MoErgo recommends using the keyboard in its fully "flat" default position while getting used to it, before making any tenting or tilting adjustments. I've mostly done this, and I've found the result to be generally very pleasant. I truly thought I _needed_ tenting, but at this point in my ergonomic journey, at least, maybe I _actually_ needed a really good palm rest that kept my wrists at a neutral angle more than that.

It should be noted that MoErgo sees the Glove80 as a kind of spiritual successor to the [Kinesis Advantage](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/); a sort of "platform" for your hands with a scooped-out key well for each set of fingers.

<figure>

![A comparison of the Glove80 and the Advantage from a side view, showing that the Glove80 is shorter, and it keys sit closer to the desktop](/images/post_images/glove80/advantage-comparison.jpg)

<figcaption>The Glove80 (left) and Kinesis Advantage (right). Image from MoErgo</figcaption>

</figure>

For many years, the Advantage was one of the only really innovative ergonomic keyboards on the market, and it seems the MoErgo makers were fans. But while it was perhaps revolutionary for its time (its layout appears to have inspired the current generation of ortholinear keyboards), it left room for improvement and iteration.

I've never used a "scooped" keyboard before, but I found the adjustment surprisingly minimal. However, that's with the strong caveat that I've already put my time in with ortholinear boards; I can touch type with them quite well at this point. I'm sure the learning curve would've been exponentially higher if this had been my first ortholinear keyboard.

<SideNote>

If you've never taken the time to learn touch typing--typing without looking, using the proper fingers for each key--I'd highly recommend it, regardless of your chosen keyboard. It's likely my shoddy ad-hoc typing form contributed to my RSI.

</SideNote>

<CalloutPlusQuote>

One of the main ergonomic goals of the Glove80 seems to be keeping your wrists in as much of a natural position as possible. That is: not bent at all, in any direction; an extension of your forearm.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

To achieve this with a scooped layout, MoErgo opted for low-profile switches and keys (Kailh Choc v1, specifically—more on the switches and keycaps in another section).

What this means is: while the keys on the Glove80 are noticeably taller than those on an Apple laptop or the Apple keyboard, they're still also significantly shorter than any standard (mechanical) keyboard.

<CalloutPlusQuote>

I notice the angle of my wrist is _dramatically_ lessened with the Glove80. Between the short switches and the lower key bed, I'd estimate my fingertips rest a full 1–2 inches lower.

</CalloutPlusQuote>

Many reviewers have commented how easy it is to slide your fingers up and down the columns of keys, and I've also had this experience. Gliding up or down from the home row is so easy I often find myself overshooting.

Which reminds me: many reviewers _also_ comment that the Glove80 works well for folks with smaller than average hands. My hands are maybe just a bit on the small side for an average male (I wear a small winter glove size, if that helps at all), and I can confirm that I can reach any key without any issue. Again: sometimes I even _overreach_, just because the keys are nestled so nicely together. The thumb keys, too, are close enough together that even reaching the furthest ones isn't an issue.

You might notice that each column of the keyboard is scooped at a little different depth, creating vertical trenches to accommodate each individual finger's length. That might look funky or intimidating, but honestly, it hasn't been an issue in my experience. If anything, it's kind of helpful; one of my more petty gripes with the Glove80 is that it doesn't include homing keys. (You can buy them, but not printed; they're just blank, which is a bummer.) On other boards, I rely on homing keys to make sure my fingers are in the proper position without looking, but here, thanks to those individually scooped finger trenches, if you're off the mark, you'll probably realize it right away.

Anyway, all that to say: so far I've been very pleased with the feel and ergonomics, and I haven't even busted out the extra hardware to do more customized tenting or tilting yet.

## Switches and keycaps

One of the biggest bummers about the Glove80 is that the switches are not hot-swappable; they're soldered in place. There's a good reason for this drawback, though.

Apparently, when the keys are as close together as the Glove80's are—and when they sit at angles, rather than uniformly flat—it can be very difficult to build, and to ensure quality.

In fairness, there aren't very many Choc v1 switches to choose from anyway.

The Glove80 ships with your choice of four switches (really, three): Red, Red Pro, White, and Brown.

The Red and Red Pro are both linear switches, which means they don't have any bump or clickiness to them; they just go straight down silently when you press them, kind of like a spring. (I personally can't stand linear switches; I like to _feel_ my keypresses register. But they work better for some people.) The Red Pro version requires less force to press, so it might be nice if you have weak fingers or RSI that gets in the way of applying force. (It's called "pro" because, in theory, you can press these switches milliseconds faster, making them ostensibly ideal for gaming. I find these claims dubious, but then again, no part of that is really my thing anyway.)

The Brown and White appear to be identical, except that the White makes a clicking sound when pressed, and the Brown does not. Both are tactile switches, which means you feel a bump when you press them.

I opted for Brown switches on my board, and as expected, they feel quite a bit like Cherry Browns, despite a lower travel distance. (If that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry. It just means the keys have a modest bump and are moderately springy, and while they make a little bit of sound, they aren't loud or clicky.)

The Brown switches are fine, but I wish there was an option with a little more oomph. I used Glorious Pandas on my Moonlander and absolutely loved them. But I don't think that's the Glove80's fault; nearly as I can tell, there just aren't any other Kailh Choc v1 switches on the market. Still, at least every major category of switch is represented (linear, tactile, and clicky).

As for the keycaps: Choc v1 keycaps seem to be much harder to find than standard Cherry-compatible keycaps. This would seem to be because Choc v1 uses its own stem (generally just referred to as Choc), which looks a bit like an electrical plug, instead of the de facto industry standard Cherry stem.

<figure>

MoErgo made this decision deliberately, however; many feel that Choc v2 switches, despite wider compatibility, only really manage to be the worst of both worlds. Turns out, many standard Cherry-compatible keycaps _aren't_ actually compatible with the low profile switch (they take up too much room for the two to fit together), and that's doubly true when the keys are so close together and angled towards each other, as on the Glove80. Choc v2 switches are also marginally taller than Choc v1, and apparently significantly less popular for all of those reasons; good in theory, bad in practice.

Anyway: still, even though v1 is by all accounts better and more popular than v2, it can still be challenging to find Choc keycaps. That said, there are at least three profiles available; the Glove80 ships with MCC profile, which is slightly sloped to create a vertical halfpipe shape (which is what lets your fingers "skate" up and down the columns of keys), but there's also MBK and MBK Convex.
