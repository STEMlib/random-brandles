I never had any real interest at all in mechanical keyboards until recently. I mostly considered them novelties; the kind of thing that was fine as a hobby, but not anything particularly practical.

Over the last year or so, however, I've been going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards, and I've discovered a much richer, more fulfilling world than I ever suspected. There's just something about nerding out over the finest details of the machine you touch and use every day that can be extremely gratifying.

I now think it was silly that I never looked any closer at things like keycaps and switches. After all, a person who spends all day on their feet will likely care deeply about their shoes; why shouldn't someone whose fingers press keys thousands of times a day be invested in how their fingers feel?

However, unlike many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, I wasn't initially drawn to the hobby by any interest in the feel, sound, look, or performance.

Instead, my gateway into mechanical keyboards was purely driven by the search for better ergonomics.

## Backstory: my history with keyboards, ergonomics, and RSI

For most of my life, whatever keyboard was attached to or supplied with the computer I was using was just fine with me. Even when I transitioned into full-time design and development, and spent my entire working day at a desk, I rarely gave any thought to the device beneath my fingertips.

Then came 2020, and the pandemic exploded in the US. The home became the workplace. I had been an in-office worker until that point, but haven't been back to work in an office since. Between my work and desperate attempts at escapism, my laptop was pretty much always, well, on top of my lap. (And even when it wasn't, it was probably on a surface that was in no way designed to be a comfortable workstation.)

Over these weeks and months, I developed a repetitive stress injury (RSI), and though I didn't know it then, it would be my first of many. This time, it was my right wrist, pinched by the angle at which it was constantly bent for typing. The pain was ever-present, at times even preventing me from holding things tightly or carrying heavy items, and it became clear it would never subside if I didn't make changes.

Over the first year of working from home full-time, I ended up spending probably around $2,000 on overhauling my at-home workplace to alleviate this pain. New chair, desk, keyboard tray, and—finally—keyboard: my first split keyboard, the [Kinesis Freestyle2 for Mac](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-mac/).

That split keyboard served me well for nearly two years; it got my hands further apart, and allowed my wrists to sit at a more natural angle. But it eventually led to another, different injury: because its layout matched the default layout of a standard Mac keyboard almost identically (apart from the split in the middle, of course), my left thumb was constantly bending at uncomfortable angles to press the command key to initiate shortcuts--in particular, the command + tab shortcut, which I use dozens if not hundreds of times a day.

That's when I started looking at keyboards with thumb keys. It made sense to me that pressing the keys you use most often with your larger, stronger thumbs, rather than with your smaller fingers--and in the natural position of your thumbs--would lead to a better outcome.

So, in asking around (mainly in the ShopTalk Show D-D-D-Discord), I eventually wound up with a ZSA Moonlander. (Chris Coyier's old one, in fact.)

At first, I hated the Moonlander. No matter how much I configured it, I was horrendously slow, and sucking at something as basic as typing is a maddeningly frustrating experience. More than once, I packed the Moonlander back in its box after a tryout, resolute to never touch it again.

Eventually, though, I decided I would never learn if I didn't go all-in. So put my other keyboards away, and used the Moonlander as my solo keyboard for a few weeks that eventually became several months.

The Moonlander was my daily driver for most of that following year, and for most of that time, I truly loved the keyboard. While the ortholinear (columnar) layout took a lot of getting used to, it paid off and felt amazing once I was finished. I even went so far as to invest in a new set of switches and keycaps for the Moonlander, which made me love it even more.

Over time, however, a new RSI flared up, even with the Moonlander.

As I write this, I'm still recovering from this latest injury, and diagnosing the cause of it. Some of it, I owe to the Moonlander specifically; some is my own fault for improper setup and usage. Some might be both.

However, I will say (as I said in my first impressions post): I think the Moonlander is a keyboard that wants to be cool first, and ergonomic second, and my experience with it over the past several months bears that out. The wrist rests are suboptimal, the tenting control you get out of the box is minimal, and the extreme tenting made possible by the Platform add-on comes with its own issues.

I _thought_ if I could get my hands on the similar Ergodox EZ, it might be similar enough to solve my problems. The Ergodox could be used with thick palm rests, and featured extra thumb keys, which sounded nice. Plus, its multiple feet seemed to offer a wider range of tenting and tilting options.

However, the Ergodox didn't turn out to be as different from the Moonlander as I'd hoped. Like the Moonlander, it was a letdown in the range of customizations it offered. Plus, the keyboard was so thick that the tall wrist rests weren't actually much better than the Moonlander's thin mounted plastic ones.

So, much as I loved my Moonlander, it became apparent that _some_ kind of change was necessary.

Again, I should emphasize that despite my valid criticisms of the Moonlander, some of my issues with it were of my own creation. (My choice of tall keycaps may even have contributed.)

But in short: I came to realize the issue came down to where and how my hands were resting when I wasn't actively typing. I don't think the Moonlander lets your palms rest comfortably in just about any position (especially not at higher tenting angles), and over time, the stress of actively holding my hands in place, rather than letting them rest properly, became a painful physical issue for me.

So, again, beset by arm pain (this time in both wrists, as well as my left elbow), I set out to find a solution.

That's when I started thinking maybe the Glove80 could be the fit I was looking for.

## Why the Glove80?

Ergonomic keyboards cover an incredibly wide spectrum. On one end, they're little more than standard keyboards with a few curves and a palm rest added. (Microsoft's [Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and Logitech's [K350](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k350-wave-ergonomic.920-001996.html) [Ergo K860](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-009166.html) both fit this bill.)

On the other end of the spectrum are keyboards that, well, barely even resemble traditional keyboards. They're often split (i.e., in two pieces, instead of one, allowing the wrists and forearms to sit straight in front of the shoulders instead of pointing awkwardly inwards together), and they frequently have a highly unconventional shape and layout.

Some can look unfinished, being little more than raw circuit boards with keys on top. Some are made to be 3D-printable. Others are high-end devices from well-known manufacturers, but which still may look very different from the type of keyboards most people use.

Not all ergonomic keyboards are mechanical, but apart from those by the major brands you'd might find in any average electronics store (like the Microsofts and Logitechs mentioned above), most are; ergonomic keyboards are generally a sub-niche of the mechanical keyboard niche.

Even if you've spent some time in this rabbit hole within a rabbit hole, though, neither Glove80 nor MoErgo are likely to be among the main names you've heard of. Generally, it seems like [Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) and [ZSA](https://www.zsa.io/) have the largest mindshare in the space, though there are others, like [Cloud Nine](https://cloudnineergo.com/), [Dygma](https://dygma.com/) and [UHK](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Nearly as I can tell, MoErgo is the least-known of those names. The Glove80 might quite possibly be the least popular keyboard of any of the above makers; just finding reviews for it was challenging. Plus—and I'm sorry in advance, but let's be brutally honest here—MoErgo's web design and store are, hands-down, the worst of the bunch. (The UHK site is poor, but it looks clean and crisp next to the decidedly dated and messy design of MoErgo's site.)

So: how and why did I buy the least-known keyboard from the least-known manufacturer with the worst website?
